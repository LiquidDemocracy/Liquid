# Liquid

Liquid is a democracy app that uses proof-of-stake Blockchain technology to achieve perfect accountability.

Block chains are great for maintaining an immutable ledger of transactions. Most use-cases so far have centered around some form of currency, but Liquid is a little different. In Liquid, instead of keeping track of currency exchanges, the block chain keeps track of changes to documents called Constitutions.

Constitutions define the procedures and policies of groups of users called Committees. A Committee is a lot like a Facebook group, or a Subreddit. Its a virtual space that facilitates discussion and media content surrounding a particular cause, subject, organization, or anything that requires policies to be put to vote. Committees can make Commits to their Constitutions. If enough votes are cast, the Commit is ratified into the Committee's Constitution, and commited to the block chain.
